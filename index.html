          <p>&quot;I see this gap which is that a young African with let's say first class degree in Mathematics in Africa would have no way to continue and to me this looks like tragedy.
          You've trained all this person all this way up and now they can't do anything and so I though let's do something to provide an avenue for them to progress.
